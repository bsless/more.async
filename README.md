# more.async

A Clojure library designed to provide more abstractions and means to communicate with Clojure's core.async channels and avoid constantly rewriting boilerplate channels handling functions, such as producing and consuming at the beginnings and ends of pipelines.

## Usage

### Dependency

Add the following dependency in your leiningen project:
```clojure
[bsless/more.async "0.0.2-alpha"]
```

### Require

```clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :as a]
         '[clojure.more.async :as ma])
```

### Use

For example, with [kinsky's](https://github.com/pyr/kinsky) kafka client:

#### Channel Producer

```
(require '[kinsky.client :as client])

(defn make-consumer
  []
  (let [c (client/consumer {:bootstrap.servers "localhost:9092"
                            :group.id          "mygroup"}
                           (client/keyword-deserializer)
                           (client/edn-deserializer))]
    (client/subscribe! c "account")
    c))

(def msg-ch (a/chan))

(ma/produce-bound-blocking
 msg-ch
 #(client/poll! % 100)
 make-consumer
 client/close!)
```

#### Channel Consumer

```
(def out-ch (a/chan))

(let [p (client/producer {:bootstrap.servers "localhost:9092"}
                         (client/keyword-serializer)
                         (client/edn-serializer))
      topic "account"]
  (ma/consume out-ch #(client/send! p topic %)))
```
